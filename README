This Game is under development and may not be ready to use yet. I will
try to keep this Readme current, but can not promise it.

It depends on
 Lispbuilder-SDL
 CL-OpenGL
 LTK
 skippy
 flexi-streams
 c2mop

You should be able to easily fetch all the dependencies via QuickLisp.

It is mainly developed under SBCL, under Linux x86_64, porting to
other platforms is planned.

To start a testing-level, do (uxul-world:start-game).

To start the leveleditor, do (uxul-world-leveleditor:level-editor), it
will return a sequence. Save this sequence somewhere, say *a*. Then to
play it, hit

(start-game :room-function #'(lambda ()
	    (uxul-world::create-room-from-item-list *a*)))

#### Currently, a Bug prevents from using the leveleditor twice
#To edit *a* again, do (level-editor *a*), and your edited level will
#be returned.

I cannot promise that all revisions I will make will work.
