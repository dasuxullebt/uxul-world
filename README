This Game is under development and may not be ready to use yet.

It depends on Lispbuilder-SDL (SVN-Revision 759 should work), LTK and lisp-magick.

To start the leveleditor, do (level-editor), it will return a sequence. Save this sequence
somewhere, say *a*. Then to play it, hit

(start-game :room-function #'(lambda () (create-room-from-item-list *a*)))

To edit *a* again, do (level-editor *a*), and your edited level will be returned.

I cant promis that all revisions I will make will work.
