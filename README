This Game is under development and may not be ready to use yet. I will
try to keep this Readme current, but cant promise it.

It depends on
 Lispbuilder-SDL (SVN-Revision 759 should work)
 LTK
 skippy
 flexi-streams
 c2mop

To start a testing-level, do (start-game).

To start the leveleditor, do (level-editor), it will return a
sequence. Save this sequence somewhere, say *a*. Then to play it, hit

(start-game :room-function #'(lambda () (create-room-from-item-list *a*)))

To edit *a* again, do (level-editor *a*), and your edited level will
be returned.

I cant promise that all revisions I will make will work.
